                    <p class="case-study__body">The first steps in this project involved migrating the already existing
                        app to the cloud. The app in its entirety is made up of three basic parts: a client site, a
                        backend API, and a database. All of these components would need to be moved to AWS in a
                        configuration that maximized the benefits of using the cloud.</p>

                    <h4>Setup</h4>
                    <p class="case-study__body">Before actually deploying anything, I set up a custom VPC where my EC2
                        instances would run. This allowed me to control ingress and egress to each component of my app
                        by dividing my network into subnets with various levels of access. The VPC was divided into
                        subnets with public access (open ingress and egress), private access (open egress but ingress
                        only from within the VPC), and even more private access for the database (ingress and egress
                        only within the VPC).</p>
                    <div class="case__img-container--aws">
                        <img class="case__image--aws" src="img/aws-case/1_VPC.png"
                            alt="screenshot of VPC configuration">
                        <p class="caption">VPC configuration: 3 public, 3 private, and 3 database subnets. Public
                            subnets route to
                            internet gateway and private subnets route to NAT gateway</p>
                    </div>
                    <p class="case-study__body">Within each of these subdivisions were three subnets (three public,
                        three private, three database), each deployed in different Availability Zones within the US East
                        1 region. This would allow for me to implement horizontal scaling later on, discussed in detail
                        later in this case study.</p>
                    <h4>Database Deploy</h4>
                    <div class="case__img-container--aws">
                        <img class="case__image--aws" src="img/aws-case/2_EC2.png"
                            alt="screenshot of list of EC2 instances">
                        <p class="caption">List of all instances running in this VPC for this app. Web servers on
                            private subnet,
                            database instances on database subnet, and bastion instance on public subnet</p>
                    </div>
                    <p class="case-study__body">Starting from the bottom layer, I decided to simply copy my database
                        onto an EC2 instance where it would run as a local MongoDB server. I learned about and
                        considered the pros and cons of other deploy methods, in particular converting the database to
                        the AWS-managed NoSQL service DynamoDB, but I ultimately didn’t use DynamoDB in order to avoid
                        some of the required refactoring and extra time needed to deploy with this method. Since this is
                        a relatively simple app with a simple database, it seemed the best choice to maintain that
                        simplicity.</p>
                    <p class="case-study__body">The EC2 instance housing my database was deployed to a database subnet
                        of my VPC, where the attached security group and lack of gateway prevented any access to the
                        public internet, but allowed certain traffic within the VPC. Following the principle of least
                        privilege, the security group only allowed traffic to and from the EC2 instances housing the API
                        (once they were created and their IPs known) and SSH access from a bastion instance deployed on
                        a public subnet.</p>
                    <h4>Server Deploy</h4>
                    <p class="case-study__body">Which brings us to the API instances. The API was initially deployed to
                        just one instance where it could be configured and copied into an AMI. The creation of this
                        instance and the deployment and configuration of the API were all done through the AWS CLI to
                        better familiarize myself with other methods of interacting with the AWS API beyond the
                        management console.</p>
                    <p class="case-study__body">The API was copied onto the instance, and a few necessary changes were
                        made to the code, such as updating the CORS policy and adding an environment variable that
                        referenced the MongoDB instance I had just made. Finally, the API was configured to run as a
                        server (on port 8081, which you may see in some screenshots).</p>
                    <h4>Refinement</h4>
                    <p class="case-study__body">While the backend of the app would have functioned fine in this
                        configuration, I wanted to simulate a real-world deployment as much as possible, which would
                        require additional measures of security and resiliency to failure. So, I followed the
                        architecture suggested by AWS as a best practice, and deployed the web server to an ASG,
                        targeted by an ALB. The 3 redundant web servers in the ASG were deployed in private subnets, so
                        they could receive traffic from the ALB and send/receive traffic to the database, but that was
                        it (besides SSH access from the bastion instance). The ALB could now distribute incoming traffic
                        across the instances, also acting as the public-facing entry point for the web servers.</p>

                    <h4>Client Site Deploy</h4>
                    <p class="case-study__body">The client-side code was relatively easier to deploy. All API calls had
                        to be updated to reference the ALB DNS, then the client code was copied into an S3 bucket and
                        configured as a static website (again using the AWS CLI).</p>

                </div>

                <div class="case-study__grid__item">
                    <h3>Adding S3 Functionality</h3>
                    <p class="case-study__body">At this point, the cloud-deployed site worked! Everything communicated
                        with each other within the cloud in the most secure way possible, following architecture
                        principles that ensured the app would always be running, and doing so efficiently. But there
                        were a few more aspects of cloud computing with which I wanted to familiarize myself that were
                        not covered in the base app, so I set about adding new functionality involving S3 buckets,
                        Lambda, the AWS SDK, and (more) IAM.</p>
                    <h4>Initial Updates</h4>
                    <p class="case-study__body">The first half of this undertaking required getting a little familiar
                        with the AWS SDK so that users could interact with the contents of the S3 bucket right from the
                        app. I started by adding a few new endpoints to the API that could upload an image, get a list
                        of images, and get a specific image from the bucket, using the AWS SDK. I then added some simple
                        UI elements in the React frontend code (pictured below), and simply tied these to the newly
                        created endpoints in the API.</p>
                    <div class="case__img-container--aws">
                        <img class="case__image--aws" src="img/aws-case/13_web-app1.png"
                            alt="screenshot of client site showing new aws functionality">
                        <p class="caption">Screenshot from client site with S3 DNS in address bar</p>
                    </div>
                    <p class="case-study__body">This also required setting up a new IAM role that allowed read/write
                        access to the bucket for the EC2 web server. This was as simple as creating read-only and
                        write-only policies for my image bucket, then attaching these to a role which could be assumed
                        by an EC2 instance.</p>
                    <div class="case__img-container--aws">
                        <img class="case__image--aws" src="img/aws-case/11_write-policy.png"

                    </div>
                    <h4>Addition of Lambda</h4>
                    <p class="case-study__body">Finally, to make use of a simple Lambda function, I set about adding
                        thumbnail functionality to these features. This meant that when a user uploaded an image, the
                        Lambda function would be triggered to create and upload a separate thumbnail of the image, and
                        this thumbnail is what would be seen when the user fetched a list of the images. The original
                        image could still be viewed by clicking on one of the thumbnails.</p>
                    <div class="case__img-container--aws">
                        <img class="case__image--aws" src="img/aws-case/8_lambda-trigger.png"
                            alt="screenshot of lambda trigger configuration">
                        <p class="caption">Lambda function configuration for creating thumbnail when image uploaded.
                            Triggers when image
                            uploaded with orig/ prefix (i.e. uploaded from client site)</p>
                    </div>
                    <p class="case-study__body">The Lambda handler function would create a thumbnail version of any new
                        image added to the bucket, then upload this new thumbnail to the bucket with a different prefix
                        using the SDK. This also required creating another IAM role with read and write access to the
                        bucket, this time to be assumed by a Lambda function.</p>
                    <div class="case__img-container--aws">
                        <img class="case__image--aws" src="img/aws-case/9_lambda-role.png"
                            alt="screenshot of lambda role">
                        <p class="caption">IAM role for Lambda function allowing basic Lambda permission, plus read +

                    </div>
                    <div class="case__img-container--aws">
                        <img class="case__image--aws" src="img/aws-case/10_EC2-role.png" alt="screenshot of ec2 role">
                        <p class="caption">IAM role for EC2 instances (web servers) allowing read + write access to
                            image bucket</p>
                    </div>
                    <p class="case-study__body">To avoid infinite recursion, the Lambda function would only trigger on
                        new objects with the “orig/” prefix, which is what would be uploaded from the client site. For
                        extra security, the handler function would also check for the thumbnail prefix and automatically
                        return without uploading anything if it was detected.</p>

                    <p class="case-study__body">And with that, the project was completed! Once I took screenshots and
                        notes to properly document everything that was done, I shut down the site to save the cost of
                        keeping all of these AWS services running, so the site is no longer live. If you want to see a
                        sample of the app in action, check out this short <a

                    <h3>Challenges</h3>
                    <p class="case-study__body">The most challenging part of this project was developing with new tools
                        (React and Parcel) and learning how best to use them as I went.</p>
                    <p class="case-study__body">Parcel’s quirks in particular slowed down production time significantly.
                        From this challenge, I was able to readjust my <img class="case-study__parcel"
                            src="img/movie-case/parcel-icon.png" alt="Parcel logo"> production schedule to set aside
                        time for learning how to best utilize this finicky tool, and I made sure to record my solutions
                        for my future self or anyone else who might view my project (which you can view at the end of
                        the ReadMe on <a href="https://github.com/liztheshiz/movie-client"
                            target="_blank">Cinema.Database’s GitHub page</a>.) This allowed me to move forward
                        efficiently with the rest of the project.

                    <h3>Hindsight</h3>
                    <p class="case-study__body">Cinema.Database was only the second full web app I had developed, so I
                        was focused mainly on learning React. Since developing this app, I have continued to learn much
                        more about other development practices and tools, so if I were to begin this project again, I
                        would likely use a different, less glitch-prone build tool like Create React App, which I
                        used to build my next project, <a href="https://liztheshiz.github.io/meetup/"
                            target="_blank">Meetup</a>.</p>
                    <p class="case-study__body">I also might prefer a more formalized testing process. While the
                        informal test-as-you-go approach worked well for a small project like this, in the future I
                        might utilize an automated, test-driven approach with a tool like Jest to keep myself practiced
                        with common tools, and to make things easier down the line should I decide to increase the scope
                        of the project.</p>
