                        <img class="case__image" src="img/movie-case/server.png" alt="image of a server">
                    </div>
                    <p class="case-study__body">Before coding anything, I listed out all the app’s functionalities that
                        would need to interact with the database, like retrieving movie details or adding a movie to
                        favorites, and then I translated these functionalities into HTML endpoints to build out the
                        structure of my Express API. This preparation step kept the initial coding efficient and
                        comprehensive, helping me know exactly where to start with my project.</p>

                            documentation here.</a>
                    </div>
                    <p class="case-study__body">I next wrote the database itself in MongoDB and updated my API to use
                        it. An important part of this step was adding layers of security to protect the data, like JWT
                        authentication which requires users to sign in to retrieve and write data, and password hashing
                        that prevents anyone (even the owner of the database) from viewing a user’s password.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p class="case-study__body">I began by building out the basic framework of the app in order to
                        familiarize myself with React’s component structure, as well as test the functionality of the
                        app without any data. Bootstrap's handy UI library sped up this process, and kept the design
                        consistent.</p>
                    <p class="case-study__body">When implementing app capabilities that involved user interaction, I
                        took extra care to note UX
                        concerns like form validation; this would become especially important as users needed to input
                        information to the specifications of the API that was working behind-the-scenes.</p>
                    <p class="case-study__body"> As a final step before deployment, I collaborated with a designer to
                        update the original design into something more eye-catching and content appropriate.</p>

                        saved for regular testing, which was carried out throughout the project each time functionality

                        attention to testing was given at integral parts of development, such as after laying out the
                        basic framework, and after linking the app with my API.</p>

                    <h3>Challenges</h3>
                    <p class="case-study__body">The most challenging part of this project was developing with new tools
                        (React and Parcel) and learning how best to use them as I went.</p>
                    <p class="case-study__body">Parcel’s quirks in particular slowed down production time significantly.
                        From this challenge, I was able to readjust my <img class="case-study__parcel"
                            src="img/movie-case/parcel-icon.png" alt="Parcel logo"> production schedule to set aside
                        time for learning how to best utilize this finicky tool, and I made sure to record my solutions
                        for my future self or anyone else who might view my project (which you can view at the end of
                        the ReadMe on <a href="https://github.com/liztheshiz/movie-client"
                            target="_blank">Cinema.Database’s GitHub page</a>.) This allowed me to move forward
                        efficiently with the rest of the project.

                    <h3>Hindsight</h3>
                    <p class="case-study__body">Cinema.Database was only the second full web app I had developed, so I
                        was focused mainly on learning React. Since developing this app, I have continued to learn much
                        more about other development practices and tools, so if I were to begin this project again, I
                        would likely use a different, less glitch-prone build tool like Create React App, which I
                        used to build my next project, <a href="https://liztheshiz.github.io/meetup/"
                            target="_blank">Meetup</a>.</p>
                    <p class="case-study__body">I also might prefer a more formalized testing process. While the
                        informal test-as-you-go approach worked well for a small project like this, in the future I
                        might utilize an automated, test-driven approach with a tool like Jest to keep myself practiced
                        with common tools, and to make things easier down the line should I decide to increase the scope
                        of the project.</p>
