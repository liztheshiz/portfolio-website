                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p class="case-study__description">Cinema.Database is a simple web app that provides
                    access to a small database of films, where users can register and save their own list of favorites.
                </p>

                    course</p>
                <p class="case-study__body"><span class="case-study__title">Purpose: </span>
                    Develop both the back- and front-end from scrath to gain experience in creating databases and
                    developing with React</p>
                <p class="case-study__body"><span class="case-study__title">Objective: </span>
                    Provide users with information about a pool of films, and an ability to save their favorites
                    for later</p>

                <div class="case-study__grid__item">
                    <h3>Server-Side</h3>
                    <div class="case__img-container">
                        <img class="case__image" src="img/movie-case/server.png" alt="image of a server">
                    </div>
                    <p class="case-study__body">Before coding anything, I listed out all the app’s functionalities that
                        would need to interact with the database, like retrieving movie details or adding a movie to
                        favorites, and then I translated these functionalities into HTML endpoints to build out the
                        structure of my Express API. This preparation step kept the initial coding efficient and
                        comprehensive, knowing exactly where to start with my project.</p>
                    <p class="case-study__body">I next wrote the database itself in MongoDB and updated my API to use
                        it. An important part of this step was adding layers of security to protect the data, like JWT
                        authentication which requires users to sign in to retrieve and write data, and password hashing
                        that prevents anyone (even the owner of the database) from viewing a user’s password.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p class="case-study__body">I began by building out the basic framework of the app in order to
                        familiarize myself with React’s component structure, as well as test the functionality of the
                        app without any data. Here I paid special attention to UX concerns like form validation. This
                        would become especially important as users needed to input information to the specifications of
                        the API that was working behind-the-scenes.
                    </p>
                    <p class="case-study__body">Once this structure was in place and its functionality tested, I began
                        loading the data from the database using all necessary permissions from the server-side.</p>
                    <p class="case-study__body"> As a final step before deployment, I collaborated with a designer to
                        update the original design into something more eye-catching and content appropriate. As this was
                        a small project, instead of working with wireframes or mockups, we looked together at design
                        ideas she had collected and I incorporated those ideas into my project (colors, fonts, layout,
                        etc).</p>

            <h2>Retrospective</h2>
            <p class="case-study__body">The most challenging part of this project was developing with new tools (React
                and Parcel) and learning how best to use them as I went. While this aspect of the project was engaging
                and I did learn to keep production rolling while I learned, Parcel’s quirks in particular did slow down
                production time significantly when compared to my original expectations. From this challenge I was able
                to readjust my production timeline to learn how to best utilize this finicky tool - including
                determining if it would be worth the time to change to another build tool, which I decided against - and
                made sure to record my solutions for my future self or anyone else who might view my project (which you
                can view at the end of the ReadMe on <a href="https://github.com/liztheshiz/movie-client"
                    target="_blank">Cinema.Database’s GitHub page</a>.)</p>
            <p class="case-study__body">Cinema.Database was only the third full web app I had developed, so the scope of
                what I focused on
                learning remained limited mainly to React. Since developing this app, I have continued to learn much
                more about common development practices and tools, so if I were to begin this project again, I might
                use a different build tool like Create React App, which I learned to use on my next project, Meetup. I
                also might use a more formalized testing process, like unit and integration testing using Jest; while
                the more informal test-as-you-go process I used was still fine for a small project like this, now that I
                know how to create automated tests I think it would be best practice to implement them, both for general
                practice and to simplify things if I ever wanted to increase the scope of this project or add more,
                complicated functionalities.</p>
