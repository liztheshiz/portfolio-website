        <h1>Cinema.Database: A Case Study</h1>

        <div class="case-study__container">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <div class="case-study__section">
                <p class="case-study">Cinema.Database is a simple web app built from scratch that provides access to a
                    small database of films, where users can register and save their own list of favorite films.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="case-study__section">
                <h3 class="case-study">Purpose and Context:</h3>
                <p class="case-study">This project was assigned as part of my studies in CareerFoundry’s Full-Stack Web
                    Development course. Its purpose was ultimately to gain experience in creating databases and
                    developing with React.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="case-study__section">
                <h3 class="case-study">Objective:</h3>
                <p class="case-study">The purpose of this app is to provide users with a way to view information about
                    films and save a list of their favorites by registering their own account.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="case-study__section">
                <h3 class="case-study">Tools:</h3>
                <p class="case-study">Tech stack: MongoDB, Express, React, Node (MERN); Build tool: Parcel</p>
            </div>
            <h2>Method</h2>
            <div class="case-study__section">
                <h3 class="case-study">Server-Side:</h3>
                <p class="case-study">I first built the structure of my server-side API using Express, planning out
                    the endpoints I would need to fulfill each of the functionalities of my database (retrieving movie
                    details, adding a movie to a user’s list, creating a user, etc). Once the basic functionality of
                    these endpoints was successfully tested with mock data in Postman, I wrote the database itself in
                    MongoDB and updated my Express API to use it, testing once again in Postman to make sure the API was
                    communicating with the database correctly.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="case-study__section">
                <p class="case-study">An important part of this process was adding layers of security to protect the
                    data, like JWT authentication which required users to sign in to retrieve and write data, and
                    password hashing that prevents anyone (even the owner of the database) from viewing user’s
                    passwords.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="case-study__section">
                <p class="case-study">The final step in creating the backend was creating the documentation so that the
                    API could, in theory, be utilized by other developers in their projects. You can view the
                    documentation here: https://cinemadatabase.herokuapp.com/</p>
            </div>
            <div class="case-study__section">
                <p>
                <h3 class="case-study">Client-Side: </h3>
                Cinema.Database was my first website built with React, so Ibegan by building the basic framework out
                to familiarize myself with React’s component structure. Once this structure was in place and its
                functionality tested, I began loading the data from the database using all necessary permissions.
                The most important measure was the use of JWT authentication when users logged in to their account,
                which then allowed them access to the database and the full functionality of the site.
                </p>
                <p>As a final step before deployment, I collaborated with a designer to update the original design into
                    something more eye-catching and content appropriate. As this was a small project, instead of working
                    with wireframes or mockups, we looked together at design ideas she had collected and I incorporated
                    those ideas into my project (colors, fonts, layout, etc).</p>

                <h2>Retrospective</h2>
                <p>The most challenging part of this project was developing with new tools (React and Parcel) and
                    learning
                    how best to use them as I went. While this aspect of the project was engaging and I did learn to
                    keep
                    production rolling while I learned, Parcel’s quirks in particular did slow down production time
                    significantly when compared to my original expectations. From this challenge I was able to readjust
                    my
                    production timeline to learn how to best utilize this finicky tool - including determining if it
                    would
                    be worth the time to change to another build tool, which I decided against - and made sure to record
                    my
                    solutions for my future self or anyone else who might view my project (which you can view at the end
                    of
                    the ReadME on Cinema.Database’s GitHub page: https://github.com/liztheshiz/movie-client).</p>
                <p>Cinema.Database was only the third full web app I had developed, so the scope of what I focused on
                    learning remained limited mainly to React. Since developing this app, I have continued to learn much
                    more about common development practices and tools, so if I were to begin this project again, I might
                    use
                    a different build tool like Create React App, which I learned to use on my next project, Meetup. I
                    also
                    might use a more formalized testing process, like unit and integration testing using Jest; while the
                    more informal test-as-you-go process I used was still fine for a small project like this, now that I
                    know how to create automated tests I think it would be best practice to implement them, both for
                    general
                    practice and to simply things if I ever wanted to increase the scope of this project or add more,
                    complicated functionalities.</p>
