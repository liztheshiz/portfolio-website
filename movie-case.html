                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p class="case-study__description">Cinema.Database is a simple web app built from scratch that provides
                    access to a small database of films, where users can register and save their own list of favorite
                    films.</p>

                </div>
                <p class="case-study__body"><span class="case-study__title">Purpose and Context: </span>
                    This project was assigned as part of my studies in CareerFoundry’s Full-Stack Web Development
                    course. Its purpose was ultimately to gain experience in creating databases and developing with
                    React.</p>
                <p class="case-study__body"><span class="case-study__title">Objective: </span>
                    The purpose of this app is to provide users with a way to view information about films and save a
                    list of their favorites by registering their own account.</p>
                <p class="case-study__body"><span class="case-study__title">Tools: </span>
                    Tech stack: MongoDB, Express, React, Node (MERN); Build tool: Parcel</p>

                    <h3>Server-Side</h3>
                    <div class="case__img-container">
                        <img class="case__image" src="img/movie-case/server.jpg" alt="image of a server">
                    </div>
                    <p class="case-study__body">I first built the structure of my server-side API using Express,
                        planning out the endpoints I would need to fulfill each of the functionalities of my database
                        (retrieving movie details, adding a movie to a user’s list, creating a user, etc). Once the
                        basic functionality of these endpoints was successfully tested with mock data in Postman, I
                        wrote the database itself in MongoDB and updated my Express API to use it, testing once again in
                        Postman to make sure the API was communicating with the database correctly.</p>
                    <p class="case-study__body">An important part of this process was adding layers of security to
                        protect the data, like JWT authentication which required users to sign in to retrieve and write
                        data, and password hashing that prevents anyone (even the owner of the database) from viewing
                        user’s passwords.</p>
                    <p class="case-study__body">The final step in creating the backend was creating the documentation so
                        that the API could, in theory, be utilized by other developers in their projects.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p class="case-study__body">Cinema.Database was my first website built with React, so Ibegan by
                        building the basic framework out to familiarize myself with React’s component structure. Once
                        this structure was in place and its functionality tested, I began loading the data from the
                        database using all necessary permissions. The most important measure was the use of JWT
                        authentication when users logged in to their account, which then allowed them access to the
                        database and the full functionality of the site.</p>
                    <p class="case-study__body"> As a final step before deployment, I collaborated with a designer to
                        update the original design into something more eye-catching and content appropriate. As this was
                        a small project, instead of working with wireframes or mockups, we looked together at design
                        ideas she had collected and I incorporated those ideas into my project (colors, fonts, layout,
                        etc).</p>

            <h2>Retrospective</h2>
            <p class="case-study__body">The most challenging part of this project was developing with new tools (React
                and Parcel) and learning how best to use them as I went. While this aspect of the project was engaging
                and I did learn to keep production rolling while I learned, Parcel’s quirks in particular did slow down
                production time significantly when compared to my original expectations. From this challenge I was able
                to readjust my production timeline to learn how to best utilize this finicky tool - including
                determining if it would be worth the time to change to another build tool, which I decided against - and
                made sure to record my solutions for my future self or anyone else who might view my project (which you
                can view at the end of the ReadMe on <a href="https://github.com/liztheshiz/movie-client"
                    target="_blank">Cinema.Database’s GitHub page</a>.)</p>
            <p class="case-study__body">Cinema.Database was only the third full web app I had developed, so the scope of
                what I focused on
                learning remained limited mainly to React. Since developing this app, I have continued to learn much
                more about common development practices and tools, so if I were to begin this project again, I might
                use a different build tool like Create React App, which I learned to use on my next project, Meetup. I
                also might use a more formalized testing process, like unit and integration testing using Jest; while
                the more informal test-as-you-go process I used was still fine for a small project like this, now that I
                know how to create automated tests I think it would be best practice to implement them, both for general
                practice and to simply things if I ever wanted to increase the scope of this project or add more,
                complicated functionalities.</p>
